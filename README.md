# IoT Exam Part 1 Cupcarbon project
 The Final Project for the first part of the Internet of Things exam in my university


 ## Project Multiple Sink Discovery 
In the IoT, a network consisting of a single sink can create scalability and energy efficiency issues. Commonly, in a single sink node network, the average number of hop counts (between sensor nodes and a sink node) increases as the network size increases. This leads to more packet loss, consumption of high energy, and a decrease in sensor nodes’ lifetime.

Write a routing algorithm, for a dense network (with at least 50 nodes) that assigns the role of “sink” to about 10 nodes, equally geographically distributed (more or less) on the external perimeter of the network. The algorithm should enlighten (mark) each node that can be considered a possible sink, respect to the requirements (being external on the network perimeter)

Try to find a good (not optimal) solution to the problem assigned.

- Describe the implemented solution in a presentation (slides) providing your reasons on the technical choices (pros / cons), the node scripts (with comments), a demo video of the simulation in CupCarbon 5 (v.5.1.6), the objectives achieved with respect to requirements, etc.
- Also provide the simulation data related to the energy consumption of the sensor network, indicating an estimate of the lifetime of the network
- Illustrate any possible improvements or criticalities (for example in terms of routing, number of messages, data storage, etc.) of the solution.
- For the delivery of the project, a ZIP archive must be created containing the .PPT or .KEY of the presentation, the CupCarbon project, any attached notes.
- The project must be delivered via email to the teacher within one week before the exam date
